= My Project Starter
:icons: font

Basically, I'm tired of having a million different projects with different file
structures and files in weird locations. So I'm going to start creating all my
projects going forward with this script and project structure to help keep me
organized

== Build File structure
.Prereq's
. Full directory path
. Project name
. Number in cluster
. Hostname for cluster

.Build
[source,bash]
----
$ /home/jmarley/projects/project\ starter/project_starter.sh
----

NOTE: This will create the basic file structure for my project


== Build clustered nodes

.Copy the latest fedora cloud image

[source,bash]
----
$ cp ~/applications/linux/fedora-cloud/installers/<image name> ./<project home>/images/
----

TODO, I want to bass this off of cloud-init and fedora atomic
