.Alias' for server cluster
After the cluster is created we will need to get the ips for each node in the
cluster and then apply them to the alias file. Then add the alias file to
~/.bashrc file

.Open Cluster in Terminal windows
NOTE: I have this manually done at the moment and need to rework the script

NOTE: example of a note
